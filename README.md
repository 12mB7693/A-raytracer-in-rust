# A Raytracer in Rust

This repository contains the implementation of a raytracer written in Rust based on the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
The implementation served as a learning project and was developed while working through the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
