# A Raytracer in Rust

![Final rendered scene](img/final-image.png)

- This repository contains the implementation of a raytracer written in Rust based on the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
- The implementation served as a learning project and was developed while working through the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Raytracer Features

- Implementation of different materials (diffuse, metal,  and dielectrics)
- Positionable camera, depth of field, and antialiasing
- Image output in PPM format

## Next steps

- add additional tests (unit tests and integration tests)
- parallelize raytracing
